# coastTrain: a global reference library for coastal ecosystems

#### Description
Despite significant recent advances in cloud-based geospatial analysis platforms and free access to immense earth observation archives, global-scale monitoring of many coastal ecosystem types has remained infeasible. This is largely due to the considerable resources required to develop large, analysis-ready, reference datasets suitable for training and testing remote sensing classification models.

coastTrain is open-access training library of coastal ecosystems suitable for training and verifying the latest generation of remote sensing classification models. coastTrain currently consists of >55,000 point locations representing confirmed occurrences of 7 coastal ecosystem types. Absence data is also included (permanent water and other terrestrial data) to enable researchers, modellers and conservation organisations to quickly develop maps of the distribution of coastal ecosystem types. 

The developers of coastTrain continually expand its capacity to support coastal ecosystem mapping and conservation and to ready it for open-access publication in 2022. Already, coastTrain includes training data from several high profile coastal mapping projects, including the [Global Tidal Flats](http://intertidal.app), [Global Intertidal Change](https://globalintertidalchange.org), the [Global Mangrove Watch](https://www.globalmangrovewatch.org/) and the [Allen Coral Atlas](https://allencoralatlas.org/).
